# Fundamental-analysis
---
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook on fundamental analysis of 3300+ stocks. The source of the data is a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cnic92/200-financial-indicators-of-us-stocks-20142018/discussion?resource=download) consisting of 200+ financial indicators of US stocks between the years 2014 and 2018.

### Next steps:
1. Getting the data from an API --> removal of csv files
2. Analysing other with other indicators
3. Possibly extend the results to a backend service and prepare user-friendly frontend to visualise the results.
